# Student_Test_Mangement
 Test management system utilizing a MySQL database. It allows users to create accounts, log in as either teachers or students, create tests, and answer tests.
    1)For teachers, it enables test creation with questions and correct answers, storing them in the database.
    2)For students, it allows them to select and answer tests, recording their results.
The code interfaces with the database to store and retrieve test-related information, and it lacks some security features such as password hashing. It's a basic system that could be further improved for better usability, security, and robustness.
